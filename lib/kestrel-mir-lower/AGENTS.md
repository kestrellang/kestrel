# kestrel-mir-lower

HIR → OSSA MIR lowering. This file documents known rules and invariants.
It is not exhaustive — when you discover a new rule, add it here.

## Debugging

- `kestrel dump mir <file> --std lang/std -f Foo.bar` dumps one function's
  post-lowering MIR (substring match on function name).
- `VERBOSE_DEBUG_OUTPUT=1` enables `debug_trace!` in the binder/semantic tree
  crates but not in this crate. Use the `kestrel-debug` crate for tracing here.

## Failable / throwing inits

`init?` and `init throws` bodies write fields into `self` and return
`Optional[()]` or `Result[(), E]`. The **caller** must unwrap this:

1. Allocate `StackAlloc(T)` — the inner type, not `Optional[T]`.
2. Call with `emit_call_returning` → captures the `Optional[()]` return.
3. `emit_discriminant` on the return value → I32.
4. `emit_switch` on the discriminant: success → `emit_take` + wrap in
   `Optional[T].Some`, failure → `Optional[T].None`.

Detection: check for `InitEffect` component on the init entity. See
`emit_failable_init_call` in `body/call/mod.rs`.

## Live value threading through branches

When emitting branches (if/else, switch, failable init), all live @owned
values must be threaded through block parameters. The pattern:

1. `saved_tracker = self.tracker.clone()`
2. `self.tracker = LiveTracker::from_live(&self.all_live_tracked())`
3. `live_vals = self.tracker.values()`, `descs = self.tracker.descs()`
4. Create blocks with `new_block_with_params(&descs)`
5. Emit terminator with `live_vals.clone()` as args to each arm
6. In each arm: `switch_to`, `rebind_scope_values`, do work, `emit_jump`
7. Restore: `restore_scope`, `switch_to(merge)`, `rebind_scope_values`
8. `self.tracker = saved_tracker; self.tracker.rebind(...)`

Values created before the branch (like a StackAlloc pointer) get new
ValueIds in each arm via block params. Use `live_vals.iter().position()`
to find the rebound version.

### Resolve held values through `value_forwarding` before consuming them

Any value materialized *before* a control-flow construct and held in a Rust-side
list (call args, aggregate fields/elements/payloads, indirect callees) names the
**pre-split** SSA id. When a later sibling expression splits the block, that id
is threaded across the merge and renamed — `rebind_scope_values` records the
rename in `value_forwarding`. A held id is therefore **stale**: consuming it
emits a use of a value stranded at a predecessor block's exit, while the live
threaded twin stays tracked in scope and is dropped at scope exit — an
over-release that double-frees any shared (e.g. COW) operand.

**Invariant:** before consuming a held value, resolve it with `resolve_value`
(which chases `value_forwarding`). Single funnels enforce this:
`emit_call_inner` resolves every arg + indirect callee; `own_aggregate_element`
resolves every struct field / tuple element / enum payload. Any *new* site that
holds a value across a possible block split and then consumes it must do the
same. Regression coverage: `memory_model/deinit/aggregate_{control_flow,try}_field_no_double_drop.ks`.

## Irrefutable destructures (let/param patterns)

`let (a, b) = expr` desugars in the HIR to a `Match` with
`MatchSource::LetDestructure` and a single arm whose body is `()`.
The normal `lower_match` path uses scope snapshot/restore, which
**wipes** the `local_map` entries created by `emit_bindings` — values
created inside the match arm become unreachable after the merge.

Fix: `lower_match` detects `LetDestructure` / `ParamDestructure` with
one arm and calls `lower_irrefutable_destructure` instead. This emits
bindings directly in the current block — no branching, no snapshot,
no restore — so `local_map` entries survive for subsequent code.

## Trust `resolve_expr_type` — but it depends on inference recording the expr

`resolve_expr_type` returns `Error` whenever inference left no `expr_types`
entry for the expression. That is usually an **upstream bug in
`kestrel-type-infer/generate.rs`**, not something to paper over here: any
branch of `gen_expr` that does an early `return` must call
`ctx.expr_types.insert(id, tv)` itself, because the generic insert only runs on
the fall-through path. A historical instance: generic enum-case constructors
(`Wrapper[Wrapper[Resource]].Some(..)`) early-returned without inserting, so the
constructed value reached MIR as a bare `Named` with no type_args and then
failed drop-shim monomorphization (`type arg arity mismatch for __drop$Enum`).
Fixed at the source. When you see `resolve_expr_type` → `Error` for a
well-typed program, look upstream first rather than reconstructing the type
from HIR here.

## var_locals

`var_locals` are mutable locals stored at stack addresses via `uninit` +
`store_init`. `map_local()` returns the **address**, not the value. Code
that reads a var_local must load from the address (`emit_copy_addr`).
Closures capturing var_locals must snapshot the value, not capture the
raw address.

## Closure captures — query, don't recompute

Closure captures come from the post-inference `ClosureCaptures` query
(`kestrel-type-infer/src/captures.rs`, the single source of truth). It is
place-based (RFC 2229): a closure reading `self.cap` captures the *field*, not
the whole `self` — that's what lets a closure over a non-Copyable receiver
compile. `lower_closure_expr` consumes the plan via `self.captures` and binds
projected places into `place_capture_map` (whole-local captures into
`local_map`); body reads are intercepted by `captured_place_value`. **Don't**
re-walk the body to recompute captures here, and `HirExpr::Closure` has **no**
`captures` field anymore. MIR applies copyability: a projected place is a
by-value capture only when Copyable + read-only; non-Copyable or written places
fall back to whole-local capture.
